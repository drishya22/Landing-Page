          <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
          <p>
            I have tried to gain professional experiences from the very starting
            of my college years. I filled out as many as applications for
            internships and scholarships based on my coding skills and participated in hackathons. I tried to
            enhance my resume by regularly updating it.

            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Future Goals</h2>
          <p>
            As a data science and computer science student, my future plans and goals are centered around leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, and apply these skills in various industries such as healthcare, finance, and environmental science
